~ Created and implemented in cooperation with Dariusz Łukasik.

The project was originally developed using GitLab service repository.

CoopSystem is a management system of programming projects that is similar in its purpose to e.g Atlassian Jira.
It is though, much less complicated and advanced project overally and was developed for different consumers - 
students of IT branch of fields, very small companies or group of programming enthusiasts.

CoopSystem was comprehensively described and documented in a Master Thesis written by Dariusz Łukasik and myself.
Having the data model prepared we started the project using JHipster service to generate a base for the application.
However, all available functions and front-end of the system were designed and developed by us.

CoopSystem was written using following tools/frameworks:
BACK-END: Java | Spring REST Framework, Spring Boot, Spring-Security, JPA (Hibernate implementation) + DB (PostgreSQL),
FRONT-END: TypeScript | Angular2.0 + PrimeNG + Bootstrap + HTML5 + CSS3,
ADDITIONAL TOOLS: Apache Maven, NodeJS

As mentioned JHipster was also used at the start to generate base of the project with appropriate tools connected.
Gimp was also used to create logo of the system.
